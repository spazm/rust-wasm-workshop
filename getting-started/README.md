# Getting Started

The first piece of the project we'll be working on is getting an exisiting Rust project compiling to WebAssembly and running in the browser.

## Current State

This directory currently only has the solution to this module as we'll be doing everything from scratch. The only prerequisite is that you have [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) installed.

## Creating a Rust Project

The first we'll do is create a normal Rust project using cargo:

```bash
$ cargo new add --lib
```

Once we have the project let's add our code to it. We'll add just a simple function named add:

```rust
pub fn add(a: usize, b: usize) -> usize {
    a + b
}
```

To make this callable from JavaScript through WebAssembly we'll need some glue code. Luckily the [wasm-bindgen](https://crates.io/crates/wasm-bindgen) can do all of this for us. Let's add wasm-bindgen to our crate as a dependency and then add the `wasm-bindgen` attribute to our add function.

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn add(a: usize, b: usize) -> usize {
    a + b
}
```

While we could compile this to a WebAssembly binary using cargo, this won't give us the JavaScript glue code we need. For that we could use the `wasm-bindgen` cli tool that reads the WebAssembly binary and produces JavaScript glue code that we can use to call the WebAssembly code. However, this is a multistep process, and we can have a tool do all these steps for us: `wasm-pack`.

To install `wasm-pack` simply run the following:

```bash
$ cargo install wasm-pack
```

We can produce our WebAssembly binary and the JavaScript glue code with the following command:

```bash
$ wasm-pack build --target web --release
```

We're running the command with the option `--target web` which will allow us to run inside a normal `<script>` tag instead of the default of being optimized for running from a JavaScript bundler.

This will run cargo and the `wasm-bindgen` CLI tool to create the WebAssembly binary and the JavaScript glue code and place it inside of `pkg` folder. wasm-pack also produces TypeScript definitions for us as well if we choose to use TypeScript.

We can then hook it all up by creating an `index.html` file that simply references the generated JavaScript glue code. We'll need to call the generated `init` function and then we can all the `add` function with no issue:

```javascript
  <script type="module">
    import init, { add } from './pkg/add.js';

    init().then(() => {
      const result = add(1, 2);
      console.log(`1 + 2 = ${result}`);
    });
  </script>
```

If we try to open the `index.html` file in a browser, we'll find an error in the console. This is because we're importing a module at a relative path which will effectively be a cross-origin request which isn't allowed.

We'll need to serve our example from a webserver so that all requests go to the same domain (i.e., localhost). Feel free to use your favorite simple http server. I use Brian Anderson's [`basic-http-server`](https://github.com/brson/basic-http-server).

If we access the `index.html` file through the web server, we'll finally see our message printed out to the console.

## Exercises

1. Try to remove as much code as possible from the generated index.js and keep the example working. See if you can explain why the piece of code you removed is safe to remove.

2. Look at the call to the WebAssembly binary - what does the call like? Do you notice anything interesting about what's done with the return value. Why might that be?

3. The wasm-pack tool helps us build our WebAssembly binary, the JavaScript glue code, and even TypeScript bindings. While convenient, we don't _need_ to use wasm-pack. Try to find out how to recreate a working example without using wasm-pack. Hint: you should only need the [wasm-bindgen](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) cli tool installed.

4. Play with passing more complex types like Strings, Vectors and references to such types to the function. Inspect the JavaScript and see if you can make sense of what's going on.
